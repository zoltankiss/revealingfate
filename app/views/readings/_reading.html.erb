<p class="disclaimer-large">
  <i>Revealing Fate</i> analyzes this chart in a systematic and analytical way—taking into account the relationships between and among certain aspects. For men the Four Pillars are read with the Yang cycle; for women they’re read with the Yin cycle. This dynamic is similar to how one may read a direction as clockwise and counterclockwise or forward and reverse.
