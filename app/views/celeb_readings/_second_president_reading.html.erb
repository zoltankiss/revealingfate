<p>Revealing Fate analyzes this chart in a systematic and analytical way—taking into account the relationships between and among certain aspects. For men the Four Pillars are read with the Yang cycle; for women they’re read with the Yin cycle. This dynamic is similar to how one may read a direction as clockwise and counterclockwise or forward and reverse.</p>
<p>Your personal Celestial Element Sign is categorized within the day pillar (marked in red text) and the following digressions are based on the interaction among all Celestial Branches, Earthly Stems, Zodiac signs, Five Phases, and Ten Gods within your Four Pillars of Destiny. For information regarding these terminologies please visit www.revealingfate.com.</p>

<h2>Significance of Your Celestial Element Sign</h2>
<p>You are born into this world from the heavens with the Yin Earth sign (Day Master)—the equivalent of the fertile soil, plentiful fields, or abundant patty. Yin Earth is the most nurturing of all the elements, and it allows all things to grow. You are giving, sensitive, and grounded when at your best; stubborn, dredging, and obstructive when at your worst. In all instances you are convicted.</p>
<p>To foster healthy relationships, you need to let things seed into you; time and patience are required for personal development. Observe the dynamic between all living things and the absorbent, fertile soil: without the essential medium for all of the Five Phases there exists no balance. You should be aware that you have a tendency to retain your emotions until the threshold is broken, creating sudden outbursts and brashness. Always keep an open mind towards all things, listening to people and signs that surround you in order to effectively communicate with all involved parties so as a consensus can be reached.</p>

<h2>Significance of the Year Pillar</h2>
<p class="significance">The Year Pillar represents the dynamics of your early life—typically from age 1 – 20 years.
It also represents the relationships with your parents, elders (such as uncles and aunts), grandparents, and in some cases legal guardians.</p>
<p>Fire is invaded by the Water element; the Yin Fire Stem sits atop a Yin Water Branch (Pig Zodiac)—within the season of Extension – Exhaustion.  Within this Pillar, the Yang Water acts as Direct Wealth to the Yin Earth Celestial Sign and Yang Wood acts as Just Officer. With this setup, it is clear that you are a pragmatically-minded individual and recognized the importance of work from an early age. You come from a well-established (yet not quite upper-class) family, however some financial incidents caused this to change during your childhood. Although you grew up in a safe, resourceful, and caring environment, your parents were particularly strict with you—and because of this you were emotionally hurt as a child and cried easily. Additionally, as a youngster you focused on your studies in a serious manner (although disinclined to do so) and put significant effort into your work and endeavors.</p>

<h2>Significance of the Month Pillar</h2>
<p class="significance">The Month Pillar represents the dynamics of your period of life from age 21 – 40 years.
It also represents the relationships with your siblings, peers, colleagues, and friends. These are the most influential people in your life during your personal development stage.</p>
<p>Metal bears the Water element; the Yin Metal Stem sits atop the Yin Water Branch (Pig Zodiac)—again, within the Season of Extension – Exhaustion. The Yin Metal within acts as Consuming Spirit; Yang Water as Direct Wealth; and the Yang Wood as Just Officer. This indicates that you are hardworking in nature and extremely progressive in goal-orienting yourself and establishing a network from an early age.</p>
<p>With the presence of Direct Wealth in the Month Pillar, this further reinforces the indication that you began working in society from an early age—in this case, your teenage years. Due to your diligent nature, you were able to earn money, acquire resources, and establish connections quite naturally since you are easily satisfied. However, soon after starting work you quickly gained public recognition for your efforts and involvement, putting strains on your closest relationships—in particular with your significant other; they often tire you both physically and emotionally.</p>
<p>With the presence of Consuming Spirit in the Month Pillar, you like to tinker with creative outlets, involvement, and projects. You like art, music, and good food. You very much appreciate reinvention through research and a hands-on approach with the things you are most passionate for. You are fond of literature and excel at a literary, catalogue, or translation tasks. You dislike relying on family pedigree as a means to project yourself and you appreciate the notion of creating your own destiny and independence.</p>

<h2>Significance of the Day Pillar</h2>
<p class="significance">The Day Pillar represents the dynamics of your period of life from age 41 – 60 years.
It also represents relationships with the self, significant other(s), and with close friends as they truly understand and accept the real, core ‘you.’</p>
<p>The Yin Earth Stem sits atop the Yin Metal Branch (Rooster Zodiac)—within the Season of Attraction – Obsession. The Yin Metal represents Consuming Spirit. You tend to attract significant other(s) with many talents who are easily made happy and gain weight. They are firm yet considerate; your relationship does not rely on or engage in one party attempting to restrict or circumvent the other—you also do not need to establish boundaries or limitations.  You have a way with words and a knack for deliverance when it comes to communication. Furthermore, when Consuming Spirit appears in the Day Pillar this shows your significant other(s) has a tendency towards promiscuity—so it is very important that you communicate effectively so that needs are addressed from both sides.</p>
<p>Your ideal partner(s) or spouse(s) is someone who thinks and calculates with careful consideration and is somewhat inward-looking. They are also excessively overthinking in nature.</p>

<h2>Significance of the Hour Pillar</h2>
<p class="significance">The Hour Pillar represents the dynamics of your late life from age 61 years – when you've completed this life.
The Hour Pillar also represents the relationships with your offspring, younger adults, and your grand-children.</p>
<p>The Yang Earth Stem sits atop a Yang Earth Branch (Dragon Zodiac)—within the Season of Growth – Regression. Yang Earth acts as Benevolent Plunder; Yin Wood as Seven Threats; and Yin Water as Indirect Wealth.</p>
<p>It is quite likely that there will be sudden and unexpected incidents to arise which will greatly affect years (or even decades) of prior investments—financial and otherwise. If you are impatient and rush for a solution to this dilemma it will most certainly end in failure. In this period of your life, you are troubled with your occupations, duties, responsibilities, and involvements. However, you pursue fame and recognition for your entire life and so therefore will have a very difficult time leaving the "stage" you have grown accustomed to operating with (ending your run of public exposure and involvement).</p>
<p>Benevolent Plunder acts strongly within your Time Pillar; you may easily pass down your inheritance or trade to your partner(s), significant other(s), and offspring. However, you do encounter considerable financial difficulties during these latter years which takes part in fueling a gradually diminishing sense of self-esteem. Furthermore, you may end up handing over your financial and business managements to other people.</p>
<p>You are prideful and therefore do not want to stay with your children in old age but often regret needing to make this decision—and regretting whichever choice you do decide to make.</p>

<h2>Five Phases Analysis:</h2>

<p>The net transformative tendencies of your elements yield a slight deficiency. This manifests as a lifelong sense of needing enhancement, adaptation, and effort—in all tasks, projects, and involvement. You sometimes give more energy than you receive in this life. You should strive towards equilibrium via the simultaneous embellishment and avoidance of certain elements. Your Four Pillars are fond of Earth and Fire respectively; and they dread Wood and Water, respectively.</p>

<h3>Nature and Disposition Analysis:</h3>
<p>You are a creative, successful, and accomplished individual who is full of dreams yet also realistic and practical. On one hand, you are fond of feeling free and unconstrained (without a care or worry); yet on the other you appreciate having two feet planted firmly on the ground (steadfast and serious). You keep to a working routine and strongly appreciate the notion of order. However, you are conflicted at the deepest level of your heart, mind, and innermost being.</p>
<p>When at your best you are abundantly ingenious and creative, full of just and righteous notions, and fond of friendship; at your worst you are often hesitant, incapable of making a decision, and emotionally vested in indecisiveness.</p>

<h3>Shao Kang-Jie’s Four Characters:</h3>
<p>The four words which poetically represent your complete life journey are Tiān Wǎn Rán Zhú (天晚然燭): "Lighting the Candle as the Day Turns to Night." This anthological excerpt is widely interpreted for a variety of conditions yet remains true among all scenarios independent of scale. It may also be translated as “Lighting the Candle as the Light Fades to Darkness.”</p>
<p>It serves as an analogy to depict the murky social environment you are involved in which surrounds your immediate periphery and your desire to be enlightened about people and decisions—using clear distinction in black-and-white terms. In ancient times, people tended to light their houses and outdoor walkways with candlelight during the night (as it was pitch-black then). However, if one lights the candle during twilight where the sun has not completely faded away—yet the night has not fully arrived—this denotes an obscure environment where the light of a candle must be used unconventionally as a tool for promoting clarity. A light must be provided to illuminate beyond the obscurity and disillusionment in order to allow one to be guided and to direct people surrounding them towards the path that is envisioned.</p>

<h3>Feng Shui Analysis:</h3>
<p>The directions of Center and South are most beneficial to you, respectively. Choose a bedroom located on the South or Southwest side of your home and position the headboard of your bed to follow suit (so that your head points to the South or Southwest). Avoid a wooden bed frame decorate your interior with stones and earthenware such as decorative rocks, vases, and pottery. Also avoid hard wood flooring and opt for granite or stone countertop. Interior decorating should follow an earthy, brown, sandy, or yellow color scheme. Candles are excellent in decoration and for meditation.</p>
<p>Certain regions of the world, countries, and hemispheres are also more beneficial to you. The best places to travel or live are Mexico, Central Africa, and the Mediterranean. You may perhaps benefit from visiting and habituating broad, dense, grounding regions with dense earth and rich geothermic activity (for example, a volcanic island or tectonic hotspot). In nature, entropic heat and rich soil is a most harmonious pairing of environment with your energetic presence.</p>

<h3>Propositions for the Day Master:</h3>
<p>Your luckiest numbers are zero and five, however two and seven are also lucky.</p>
<p>The transitionary periods between the changing seasons are particularly preferable for you. The mid-summer season and hot weather are also beneficial. However, do not act recklessly in the spring. It is also important to occupy an environment not too humid.</p>
<p>The months of Earth and years of Ox, Goat, Dragon, and Dog are comparatively lucky, respectively; the months of Fire and years of Snake and Horse are also somewhat lucky, respectively. Exercise caution and deep introspection during the months of Wood and years of Rabbit and Tiger, respectively.</p>
<p>Your most auspicious times are between the hours of one and three (both AM and PM), however the hours between seven and nine (both AM and PM) and the lunchtime (high noon) hours are also auspicious. You generally fare better at engaging in meaningful work at two and eight o’clock (both AM or PM) and should avoid all important matters and serious activity during the mid-morning.</p>
<p>Your auspicious colors are Brown (with darker brown as more favorable), Yellow, Red, and Purple. Avoid Green (especially dark Green), Blue, Grey, and Black.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Suggestions</h2>
<p>Your parents likely experienced financial concerns surrounding real estate or mortgage during your childhood, and this caused parental issues which made for some tumultuous experiences. This is indicated by the presence of Indirect Resource of the Ten Gods within your Year Pillar.</p>
<p>You began dating (or becoming involved with the opposite sex) at an earlier age than most at the time. This is indicated by the presence of Just Officer of the Ten Gods within your Year Pillar.</p>
<p>Although you are particularly studious regarding education, you held a certain reservation in regards to an absolute focus on higher education and instead managed your time between your university studies and part-time job(s). This is indicated by the presence of Direct Wealth of the Ten gods within your Month Pillar and the relative prevalence of the Water element in relation to that of the Wood element within your Net Transformative Tendencies of the Five Phases.</p>
<p>You are the ideal friend to those in your immediate social circle. This is indicated by the presence of Just Officer within your Month Pillar.</p>
<p>You place an emphasis on looking young and beautiful even as you age well beyond your 60s—and there will be no lack of pursuers that you garner attention from. This is indicated by the presence of Seven Threats of the Ten Gods within your Time Pillar.</p>
<p>Despite financial hardships you face in the latter period of your life, you aim to keep earning as much money as possible and will likely remain increasing your wealth and net worth. This is indicated by the presence of Indirect Wealth of the Ten Gods within your Time Pillar.</p>
<p>Your significant other(s) is someone you diligently and attentively support through direct output and guidance. You also provide them with emotional resources. This is indicated by the presence of Consuming Spirit of the Ten Gods within the Day Pillar.</p>
<p>Medicine only has a slight effect on you in your old age, since you are particularly prone to internal conflict. This is indicated by the prevalence of Benevolent Plunder of the Ten Gods within your Time Pillar.</p>
<p>Your grandchildren are difficult to look after. This is indicated by the presence of Seven Threats of the Ten Gods within your Time Pillar.</p>
<p>Your physical body is prone to deficiency, stagnation, dampness, and specific health issues involving veins, arteries, nerves, and the heart, lung, liver, and kidney channels, respectively (Traditional Chinese Medicine terms). These represent inhibited cellular metabolism, poor or diminished tissue expression, fluid retention, and involve the cardiovascular, pulmonary, circulatory, and endocrine systems, respectively. Should problems occur they will likely manifest as fatigue, edema, personality disorder, neurological and memory issues, incontinence, hypotension, blood-clotting, seizure, heart disease, and heart attack. You are especially prone to fear and nervousness, respectively. To avoid this, relish in your joyful experiences and empathic exchanges with others in an uninhibited fashion. Additionally, you should avoid overindulgence in salty foods and snacks, excessive thinking, worrying, and anxious behaviors. This is indicated by the overabundance of Water and lack of Fire within your Four Pillars, and the dynamics of having to supplement Earth and Fire, respectively.</p>
<p>You should do gardening, go camping, and go on walks for exercise; play chess for leisure; and take solace in spiritual ceremony. This is indicated by your Net Transformative Tendencies of the Five Phases, Feng Shui dynamics, and an affinity for the Earth element.</p>
<p>You are extremely capable of establishing plans and strategies but slightly weaker at executing them. This is indicated by both the conflicting forces of Earth and Water and diminishing force of Water on Fire within your Four Pillars.</p>
<p>Although you are born to the Yin Earth Celestial Sign, you are a notably well-rounded individual when it comes to energetic interaction among your natural and social environments. Because of this, you are less likely to hold very strong stances on a wide variety of topics and notions; you "play the game" rather than creating your own rules and you tend to operate within previous establishments or constructs. You realize that in order to achieve your goals in life you are always required to compromise on all things—and this frustrates you greatly. It frustrates you to such an extent that it becomes your primary life challenge and stressor (often causing stomach cramps in particular). Furthermore, you have the unique ability to bring people together on specific issues due to your compromising nature. You are naturally diplomatic (which earns you the ability to gather the support of multiple factions), but you are also easily capable of utilizing alternative plans and initiating deals elsewhere—you always have a backup. This is indicated by the dynamic between a moderately strong endowment of the Stars of Assistance of the Ten Gods and the relative balance of all Elements within the Net Transformative Tendencies of the Five Phases.</p>
<p>You are stuck between taking an idealist stance on what you believe and a pragmatic execution on doing what is viable for you. This leads to much inner conflict needing to be addressed. You can remedy this by surrounding yourself with people who align with your sentiment and share your observations as well as those who passionately support your ideological stances, respectively. Such will lighten the inner burden you face. This is indicated by the dynamics of the Net Transformative Tendencies of the Five Phases benefiting from the Stars of Assistance and the Stars of Nurturing, respectively.</p>
<p>Be wary of energies and people that attempt to restrict or taper your convictions or compromise your beliefs. You also need to avoid situations that prompt you to value reactionary or calculated measures more so than careful consideration or open reception. This is indicated by the dynamics of the Net Transformative Tendencies of the Five Phases avoiding Wood, Water, and Metal, respectively.</p>
