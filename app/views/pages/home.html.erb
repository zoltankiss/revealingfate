            The accuracy of a reading in Chinese astrology is
            second to none.
            Western astrology greatly falls short with
            overgeneralization and under-evaluation.
            Chinese astrology instead provides a much more
            expansive narrative and has the ability to
            exquisitely detail all explanations for how you
            should live your life and the significance of it.

<p>
    It’s no wonder that humankind has guarded and preserved such a sacred and precious cultural 
    relic for more than 5,000 years—and continues to do so. This is a sign from the heavens to 
    connect with your greater purpose.
