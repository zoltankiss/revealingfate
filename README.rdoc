== README

Our workflow looks something like this: we pick out tickets in trello. Once we write the code to satisfy the ticket, we will make a "pull request". This is an elegant idea github uses so that people can review your code before its merged into a remote branch. So we have 2 branches: master and staging. Master is the code that is used on the production site, www.revealingfate.com, and staging is used on our testing or "staging" site, http://dry-taiga-8961.herokuapp.com/. Once your pull request looks good, I'll merge it and deploy it to the staging server. We then drag the trello ticket to "deployed to staging and neither done nor rejected". Kyle then tests it on the staging server, and if it looks good, he drags it to "done".
